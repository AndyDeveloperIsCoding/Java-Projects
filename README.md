# Java Projects

<br/>

Following are some of my projects, that I developed while studying Java Core, Gradle, SQL and REST. See the project's difficulty levelin brackets. <br/>

**2) Tic-Tac-Toe (easy)**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game <br/>

Practiced skills: basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.

I know a little bit more of Java, than I used in these projects. I will demonstrate my other knowledge in the projects to come.
Feel free to ask me about writing the code for these programs. <br/><br/>
