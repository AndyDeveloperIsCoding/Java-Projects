# Java Projects

<br/>

Following are some of my projects, that I developed using Java Core, Spring Boot (Web, Data, Security), Gradle, Maven, SQL databases and REST. See the project's difficulty level in the brackets. <br/>
<br/>


**6) To-Do Management System/ fullstack app (hard)**: <br/>
Spring backend: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/todo_management_system_Spring (database is set to create-drop) <br/>
React frontend: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/todo-management-system_React <br/>
Fullstack in Docker: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/todo_management_system_docker
Utilized technologies: Java Core, Spring Boot, Maven, PostgreSQL, REST API, React, NPM.

**5) Recipes (challenging)**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Recipes <br/>
Utilized technologies: Java Core, Spring Boot and Security (password encoding, user authentication and authorization), Gradle, Apache Tomcat, SQL database, REST API and JSON.

**4) Simple Banking System (medium)**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Simple-Banking-System <br/>
Utilized technologies and concepts: Java Core, Gradle, SQLite, banking system way of working, Luhn algorithm for bank card number generation.

**3) Coffee Machine (easy)**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Coffee-Machine-Program <br/>
Utilized concepts: challenging loops and conditions, working with classes.

**2) Tic-Tac-Toe (easy)**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game <br/>
Utilized concepts: planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

**1) Simple Chatty Bot (easy)**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Simple-Chatty-Bot-Program <br/>
Utilized concepts: basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.

I know a little bit more of Java, than I used in these projects. I will demonstrate other skills in the projects to come.
Feel free to ask me about writing the code for these programs. <br/><br/>
