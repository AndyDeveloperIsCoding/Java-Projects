These are some of my projects, that I developed while studying at Hyperskill.org (JetBrains Academy) platform

Practiced skills: challenging loops and conditions, working with classes.

**2) Tic-Tac-Toe**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game <br/>
Practiced skills: planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

**1) Simple Chatty Bot**: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Simple-Chatty-Bot-Program <br/>
Practiced skills: basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.

I know a little bit more of Java, than I used in these projects. I will demonstrate my other knowledge in the projects to come.
Feel free to ask me about writing the code for these programs.
