# Java Projects
These are some of my projects, that I developed while studying at Hyperskill.org (JetBrains Academy) platform

- Simple Chatty Bot: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Simple-Chatty-Bot-Program
- Tic-Tac-Toe: https://github.com/AndyDeveloperIsCoding/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

I know a little bit more of Java, than I used in these projects. I will demonstrate my other knowledge in the projects to come.
Feel free to ask me about writing the code for these programs.
